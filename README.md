# Color Detection

In this color detection Python project, we can get the name of the color by double-clicking on it. <br>
We have a CSV that contains the color name and its values. <br>
We calculated the distance from each color hex value and find the shortest one and display that particular color.

Requisites : python openCV pandas <br>
```pip install opencv-python pandas```
